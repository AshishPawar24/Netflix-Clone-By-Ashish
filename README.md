# 🎬 Netflix Homepage Clone

A static clone of Netflix’s landing page built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project was developed as a part of my learning journey in frontend development — focusing on responsive design, layout structuring, and basic DOM manipulation without using any libraries or frameworks.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To replicate the core UI of Netflix's homepage and understand how modern web layouts work. This includes learning:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive CSS layouts
- Positioning, hover states, modals, and basic interactivity using JavaScript

---

## 🚀 What I Built

### ✅ Features Implemented:

| Section                 | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Navbar**              | Netflix logo and Sign In button, styled and positioned using flexbox |
| **Hero Banner**         | Background image with headline text and call-to-action button |
| **Modal Login Popup**   | Triggered on "Sign In", includes form fields and blur overlay effect |
| **Feature Sections**    | Informative sections with text and images, positioned left/right alternately |
| **FAQ Accordion**       | Expand/collapse answers on click using JavaScript logic |
| **Footer**              | Includes links and language selection, mimicking the Netflix design |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structuring the page content  
- **CSS3** – for styling, layout design, and media queries  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – for modal toggle, FAQ accordion, and interactivity

## 📚 What I Learned

- Built responsive layout using **Flexbox** and **media queries**
- Applied **CSS positioning techniques**: absolute, relative, z-index
- Implemented **modal popups**, overlays, and blur effects using JavaScript
- Developed **FAQ accordion** using basic JS toggle logic and event handling
- Managed **hover effects**, transitions, and responsive styling for modern UI
- Used **semantic HTML structure** for cleaner and accessible layout
- Practiced JS concepts like:
  - Variables, Functions, DOM manipulation (`getElementById`, `querySelector`)
  - Event handling (`addEventListener`, `onclick`, `event.preventDefault`, `event.key`)
  - Loops (`for`), conditionals (`if/else`), string methods (`.includes()`)
  - `setTimeout` for delay, `window.onscroll` for scroll-based UI behavior
  - CSS class manipulation (`.classList.add/remove/toggle`)
  - DOM traversal and dropdown/modal logic

## 🤖 Assistance

- 🔍 Leveraged **AI tools** for debugging layout and handling complex JavaScript logic  
- 📹 Referred to a **YouTube tutorial** for structural guidance and layout flow
